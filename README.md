# Pathfinding algorithm visualization tool

This application is a visualization tool that allows a user to see how differents path finding algorithm search for the shortest path. The project isn't done, there is gonna have more algorithm. For now, I did the Dijkstra, the Greedy Best-First Search and the A Star algorithm.

I did this project mainly to learn about path finding algorithm and to get better at doing visualization tools. I also wanted to get better in Typescript. 

## How does it work 

![GitHub Logo](images/general.png)

It's quite simple, click where u want the start (orange) and then end (blue). Then, put some walls by draging your mouse while the left button is pressed on the grid. You can also change the algorithm for the visualization.

After, press on visualize to see the algorithm in action.

To reset the visualization without clearing the walls and the start and end position, press clear visualization. To clear everything, press reset.


## Installation


You need all the things for a basic react app and material-ui.

Run 'npm start' to start the server and try out this visualization tool
